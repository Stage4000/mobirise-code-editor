## 0.2 (2019-03-31)

- Added side-by-side editors, one for HTML, one for CSS
- Updated the way the Javascript libraries are loaded. This solves the bug where code highlighting didn't always work, or active line didn't show, etc.
- Added check if a block's "_customHTML" is available. If it isn't, the user receives a warning that the editor can't be used to edit said block
- Added "edit" icon to each block
- Removed "editor" icon from Mobirise navbar
- Removed bunch of (now) unused coding

## 0.1 (unreleased)

This is the initial release of the Code Editor extension for Mobirise, forked from DeltaPi's Code Editor.
